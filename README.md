## üí° Personalization Logic
- Personalized feed is based on user‚Äôs preferred tags and followed users.
- Users can set their preferences and follow others to influence their feed.

---

## üèóÔ∏è How to Run

1. **Clone the repo**
2. **Set up Supabase**: Create a project, run the migrations, and set your environment variables
3. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
4. **Start the app**: `npx expo start`

## üìù Notes
- Deep linking for Google Auth may behave differently in Expo Go vs. custom builds. If you have issues, try hardcoding the redirect URL as a workaround.
- All sensitive operations are protected by Supabase RLS.
